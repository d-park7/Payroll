# Payroll
(CURRENTLY WORK IN PROGRESS)
A payroll program that lets employees clock in and out and then calculates a biweekly paycheck based on the times and wage.

TO USE THIS:
`docker-compose up --build`

# Payroll

This program will calculate a given employee's wages from 2 selected dates.
This project currently only sets up a very simple flask api and postgres database.

## Additional Notes

Ignore the *others* and *frontend* directory as I am currently updating this project.
